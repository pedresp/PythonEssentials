## 3.2.14 Essentials of the *while* loop

**Problem:** a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.

Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall – it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.

Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers – if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.

**Solution:** pyramid.py
